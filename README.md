A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on multiple features using Multiple Linear Regression.
This model helps understand how different factors such as area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms influence the final price of a house.

The workflow includes:
1.Data cleaning
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Correlation study
4.Model training
5.Evaluation
6.Prediction on new values
